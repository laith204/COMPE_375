# COMPE 375 â€“ Embedded Systems & Microcontroller Programming  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains coursework and lab projects from **COMPE 375**, a course focused on **embedded systems and microcontroller programming**. The course utilized the **ATmega328PB Xplained development board** along with **Atmel/Microchip Studio** for writing, compiling, and flashing code to the microcontroller. Labs covered fundamental embedded concepts such as **LED control, UART communication, keypad scanning, PWM, and sound generation**.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328PB Xplained Development Board  
- **IDE**: Atmel/Microchip Studio  
- **Communication Interface**: UART (tested using PUTTY)  
- **Programming Language**: C  

## ðŸ“‚ Lab Topics  
Each lab introduced and built upon core embedded system concepts:  

- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 0 â€“ LED Blinking** â€“ Basic GPIO control for toggling an LED  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 1 â€“ Name Display & Morse Code** â€“ Displayed my name using an LED and converted it into Morse code  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 2 â€“ UART Communication** â€“ Sent my name and ID through UART and received it on a PC using PUTTY  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 3 â€“ 4x4 Keypad Scanner** â€“ Scanned a keypad and sent pressed key values to PUTTY via UART  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 4 â€“ LED PWM & Button Control** â€“ Adjusted LED brightness based on button press duration (PWM duty cycle control)  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 5 â€“ Sound Output & Keypad Scanner** â€“ Adjusted output sound frequency based on keypad input  
- ðŸ”¹ **Lab 6 â€“ Keypad Scanner & LED PWM** â€“ Used keypad input to increase or decrease LED brightness via PWM
